        <h2>What is the Stoned Ape Theory?</h2>
        <p> The Stoned Ape Theory basically states that psychedelic mushrooms were the catalyst that helped 
            our species arise from ancient hominids. In short, it says that psilocybin, the main active 
            compound in shrooms, altered the behavior of Homo erectus, which first evolved two million 
            years ago, in ways that set them on an evolutionary path towards us, modern humans. </p>
        <p>The theory is based on the idea that early human ancestors, living in African savannas around 
            2 million years ago, began consuming psilocybin mushrooms that grew on the dung of grazing 
            animals. These mushrooms would have had a profound effect on the brain, leading to increased 
            neural plasticity and the development of new cognitive abilities, such as language and abstract thinking.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Where did the theory come from?</h2>

        <p>The theory has its roots in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553371304/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=howstuffwo029-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=19c3294f24c29dfc85a58dd00f3dc278&creativeASIN=0553371304">
            <i>Food Of The Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge</i></a>, 
            published by Terrence McKenna in 1992. McKenna was an American ethnobotanist, a branch of science 
            that studies how different cultures or groups of people traditionally employed plants in their 
            environment for medical, cultural, or other purposes. In "Food of the Gods," Terence McKenna made 
            his argument based on noted qualities of the psychedelic experience (such as augmented empathy and 
            sensory perception), shamanistic traditions in ancient cultures, and the known and hypothetical 
            range of psychedelic plants and fungi in ancient times.</p>

        <h2>Do psychedelics actually work?</h2>

        <p>The field of psychedelic research is constantly evolving, yet most new research supports the idea that
            psychedelics can be used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. 
            A <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811211073759">2022 study</a> by Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers published in the <i>Journal of Psychopharmacology</i> 
            found that psilocybin-assisted therapy had substantial antidepressant effects for lasting periods of time.

            <figcaption> <b>Figure 1. Decrease in GRID-HAMD depression scores over time from baseline through the 12-month follow-up (N = 24). </b></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 (see below), the researchers reported that psilocybin treatment in both groups produced large decreases in depression, 
            and that depression severity remained low one, three, six and 12 months after treatment. Depressive symptoms were measured before 
            and after treatment using the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a standard depression assessment tool, in which a score of 24 
            or more indicates severe depression, 17–23 moderate depression, 8–16 mild depression and 7 or less no depression. For most participants, 
            scores for the overall treatment decreased from 22.8 at pretreatment to 8.7 at one week, 8.9 at four weeks, 9.3 at three months, 7 at 
            six months and 7.7 at 12 months after treatment. Participants had stable rates of response to the treatment and remission of symptoms 
            throughout the follow-up period, with 75% response and 58% remission at 12 months.</p>
